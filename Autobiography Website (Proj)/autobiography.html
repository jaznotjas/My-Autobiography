        <p>Hey everyone! This is all about my life story â€“ so far! You'll find stuff about what I've been up to, the things that matter to me, and maybe even some embarrassing moments (don't worry, I'll keep them tame!). Think of it as an ongoing diary,
            but way more interesting (hopefully). So, come on in and explore!</p>

                <p>I'm <b>Jasmine Ragot Jamlid</b>. Just call me "Jaz" for short. born 24th of July 2004 in Poblacion, Bansud, Oriental Mindoro. I describe myself as introverted by nature, but my extroverted side shines through with close friends. I'm passionate
                    about things I like. I can be very indecisive on everything, although I still enjoy being the decision-maker. I consider myself a little creative. I like listening to music (mostly pop, rock and a mix of both), and I enjoy photography,
                    as well as funny memes. I dislike obsequious behavior, bigotry, being disturbed while I'm doing something, and people who get in the way of things I want to do.</p>
